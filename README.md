## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+ and Pip
-   Node.js and npm/yarn
-   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_USERNAME]/PaperTrail.git
    cd PaperTrail
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend (in `/backend` directory):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Download NLP models (e.g., for SpaCy)
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

3.  **Setup Frontend (in `/frontend` directory):**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend

    # Install JavaScript dependencies
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` root directory. This file will store your secret keys and database configurations.
    ```env
    # .env example
    SECRET_KEY='your_super_secret_key'
    DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:password@localhost/papertrail_db'
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # From the /backend directory
    flask run
    ```
    The backend API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
